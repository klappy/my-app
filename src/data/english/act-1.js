1 I made the first account, O Theophilus, about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
2 until that day when he was taken up, having given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,
3 to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs, appearing to them for 40 days and speaking things concerning the kingdom of God.
4 And meeting together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, “which you heard from me,
5 that John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit after these not many days.”
6 They therefore having assembled, they were asking him, saying, “Lord, if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”
7 But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”
9 And having said these things, as they were looking, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
10 And while they were looking intently into heaven as he was going up, and behold, two men stood by them in white clothes.
11 And they said, “Men, Galileans, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, the one having been taken up from you into heaven, thus will come, the way you saw him going into heaven.”
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill that is called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, having a journey of a Sabbath.
13 And when they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying, both Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas of James.
14 They all were continuing unanimously in prayer, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.
15 And in those days Peter, having stood up in the midst of the brothers, said (and the multitude of names to the same was about 120),
16 “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, the one having become a guide to the ones arresting Jesus.
17 For he was numbered with us and received a share of this ministry.”
18 (Now indeed this one bought a field from the wage of unrighteousness, and having fallen headfirst, he burst open in the middle, and all his entrails were poured out.
19 And it became known to all those living in Jerusalem. Therefore that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
20 “For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation become desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it,’ and ‘Let another take his overseership.’
21 Therefore it is necessary, of the men having accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,
22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these {is} to become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
23 And they stood up two, Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was named Justus, and Matthias.
24 And praying, they said, “You, Lord, heart-knower of all, show which one from these two you have chosen
25 to take this place of ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”
26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was chosen together with the 11 apostles.`;
