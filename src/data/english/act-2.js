1 And when the day of Pentecost was completely filled, they were all together to the same.
2 And suddenly a sound came from heaven, as of a strong wind being borne along, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
3 And tongues as if of fire appeared to them, distributing themselves, and they sat upon each one of them.
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit was giving them to speak out.
5 Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, godly men, from every nation of those under heaven.
6 And when this sound happened, the multitude came together and was confused, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.
7 And they were all amazed and were marveling, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
8 And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born?
9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those inhabiting Mesopotamia, Judea and also Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10 Phrygia and also Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya that {are} near Cyrene, and Romans visiting,
11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we are hearing them speaking in our languages the great things of God.”
12 So they were all amazed and were perplexed, saying one to another, “What does this want to be?”
13 But others, mocking, were saying, “They are filled with sweet wine.”
14 But Peter, having stood with the eleven, raised up his voice and spoke out to them, “Men, Jews, and all the ones inhabiting Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and take my words into your ears.
15 For these are not drunk as you are assuming, for it is the third hour of the day.
16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
17 ‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams.
18 And even on my male servants and on my female servants in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
19 And I will give wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
20 The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes.
21 And it will be, everyone who may call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”’
22 Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene {was} a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know.
23 This one, given up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you killed by the hand of the lawless, having fastened,
24 whom God raised up, having loosed the agonies of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
25 For David says about him, ‘I saw the Lord before me through all, for he is at my right so that I should not be moved.
26 Because of this, my heart was glad and my tongue exulted. And indeed, my flesh will also dwell in hope.
27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
28 You made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with gladness with your face.’
29 Men, brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
30 Therefore, being a prophet and having known that God had sworn to him with an oath to set from the fruit of his loins upon his throne,
31 having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.
32 This Jesus, God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you both see and hear.
34 For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right
35 until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.”’
36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
37 And hearing this they were pierced in the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men, brothers, what should we do?”
38 Then Peter said to them, “Repent and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
39 For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those {being} at a distance, as many as the Lord our God may call.”
40 And with many other words he testified and urged them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”
41 Therefore, having received his word, they were baptized, and about 3,000 souls were added in that day.
42 And they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers.
43 And fear was coming on every soul, and many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles.
44 And all those believing were to the same and had all things in common,
45 and they were selling properties and possessions and they were distributing them to all, as anyone might have need
46 and, continuing unanimously every day in the temple and breaking bread in each house, they were sharing food with exultation and sincerity of heart,
47 praising God and having favor with the whole people, and each day the Lord was adding the ones being saved to the same.`;
